                <p>Hello! I'm Derek Ambrose and I am a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, the older of my parents' two children.</p> 
                    
                <p>I have a background in Sports Communication and hold two masterâ€™s degrees (from Emory University and The Interdenominational Center) and both schools are located in Atlanta, Georgia. I have worked in management roles both as a graduate student and as an Army Officer. I played football at Mississippi State on athletic scholarship.  
                    
                <p>Presently, I am pursuing a new career path in Web Development and am enrolled at the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. Prior to "tech", I was a stay-at-home dad, and prior to becoming a veteran I worked with graduate students as the Assistant Dean of Student Support and Recruitment.</p>
                    
                <p>I have three children: Channing, my "princess"; Kensington, my "pearl"; and last but not least, Gabriel, who's nickname is "Jesus Christ, Gabriel".<p>

                <p>Fun fact: I have seen "Frozen" at least 50 times more than you - guaranteed.</p>
